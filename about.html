                <h2 class="section-title">Our Mission</h2>
                <p class="section-subtitle">To reimagine how children learn by transforming screens from digital pacifiers into portals for discovery, blending storytelling, cognitive science, and technology to spark curiosity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="why-container animate-on-scroll fade-up" style="text-align: center;">
                <h3 class="why-title">Our Why</h3>
                <p class="why-text">Children today spend an average of 4+ hours a day on screens, and 90% of 8-year-olds already own tablets. Passive video content like CoComelon rewards short attention spans, replacing curiosity with quick dopamine hits. Education means freedom, and good learning habits start at a young age. As founders with a passion for education and close family at this age, we want to help build a better future for them.</p>
                <p class="why-conclusion">We believe the solution isn’t to ban technology, it’s to build better technology.</p>

                                <h5>Entrepreneurship Story</h5>
                                <p>Entrepreneurship has always been part of my life.</p>
                                    
                                <p>I designed and sold books on Amazon KDP, ran a tutoring agency, helped my dad run his Gumtree side hustle, explored content creation through creative projects, and even worked in a legal startup.</p>

                                <p>Each venture, big or small, taught me how to spot opportunities, build community, and solve problems creatively. These experiences are what fuel my work today with curiosiBEE.</p>

                                <p>To me, education is power. My parents always taught me that education brings freedom; freedom to grow, to change one’s life, and to contribute meaningfully to society. Education uplifts economies, opens career opportunities, and empowers those in difficult situations to rewrite their futures. I went to a regular public school and succeeded relying on hard work, resilience, and curiosity. That experience shapes my vision: I want education to be accessible to everyone, especially minority and underrepresented groups. Knowledge should never be a luxury, it should be a right.</p>

                                <p>With curiosiBEE, I want to build more than just another EdTech tool. I want it to: <br>
                                - Empower students by making them feel confident, motivated, and excited to learn.<br>
                                - Nurture curiosity and passion, the heart of lifelong learning.<br>
                                - Be a humanised platform; not only about study content, but also about life skills, personal growth, and strong learning habits.<br>
                                - Create a space where students feel supported, celebrated, and inspired, just as much as teachers feel empowered to engage them.</p>   
                                    

                            <p>My dream is that curiosiBEE becomes a platform people are genuinely excited to use, a place where education is reimagined as joyful, powerful, and deeply human.</p>

                                <p>Hey there! I’m Saswat and I’m a robotics/mechatronics engineer at UNSW who just happens to have immense entrepreneurial sprit.</p> 
                                
                                <p>Ever since I was in school, I’ve always had strong interest for starting side hustles from reselling shoes, to starting off that drop-shipping gig we’ve all probably have started before 😆.</p>

                                <p>Currently I’m learning lot more about business and investing. I’m currently building a tutoring agency in Canberra, and have helped more than 20 students.</p>

                                <p>As I continue my pursuits in tutoring and education, I’ve seen firsthand through personal experiences and from my students, of the current issues in the Aussie education.</p>

                                <p>So what’s better than creating curiosiBEE with my 3 other amazing co-founders to combine our passion in helping the future of Aussie education.</p>

                                <p>Unlike the fluff in other edtech startups, we aim to make a true difference to education in Australia. Stay tuned, exciting stuff is to come!</p>

                                <p>If you check out my embarrassing GitHub bio from 2020/2021, I actually wrote that I was conflicted between doing something in the medical field, tech, or heading the entrepreneurial route. I am kind of doing all three things right now, so that is rather exciting!</p>

                                <p>I'm very passionate about education because I am both an educator and a student. As a student, I always yap about how the education system sucks, how some teachers suck, and how educational policies suck. As an educator, I am mindful of the issues in education but feel a bit stuck that I can't do much about it and just have to focus on teaching. As an entrepreneur, I am excited about EdTech innovation.</p>

                                <p>I am excited about how my team and I are going to build MOTIBEE. We changed our ideas a couple of times, and won't be surprised if we change some more. But one thing is certain: I hope we can disrupt traditional education.</p>

                <p>CuriosiBee began as an idea sparked from Hritu’s 5-year-old sister who was already an “iPad kid.” Seeing how early digital addiction starts, our founders asked a simple question:</p>
                <blockquote class="key-question">
                    What if screens could make kids more curious instead of more distracted?
