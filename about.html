                                <h5>Entrepreneurship Story</h5>
                                <p>Entrepreneurship has always been part of my life.</p>
                                    
                                <p>I designed and sold books on Amazon KDP, ran a tutoring agency, helped my dad run his Gumtree side hustle, explored content creation through creative projects, and even worked in a legal startup.</p>

                                <p>Each venture, big or small, taught me how to spot opportunities, build community, and solve problems creatively. These experiences are what fuel my work today with curiosiBEE.</p>

                                <p>To me, education is power. My parents always taught me that education brings freedom; freedom to grow, to change one’s life, and to contribute meaningfully to society. Education uplifts economies, opens career opportunities, and empowers those in difficult situations to rewrite their futures. I went to a regular public school and succeeded relying on hard work, resilience, and curiosity. That experience shapes my vision: I want education to be accessible to everyone, especially minority and underrepresented groups. Knowledge should never be a luxury, it should be a right.</p>

                                <p>With curiosiBEE, I want to build more than just another EdTech tool. I want it to: <br>
                                - Empower students by making them feel confident, motivated, and excited to learn.<br>
                                - Nurture curiosity and passion, the heart of lifelong learning.<br>
                                - Be a humanised platform; not only about study content, but also about life skills, personal growth, and strong learning habits.<br>
                                - Create a space where students feel supported, celebrated, and inspired, just as much as teachers feel empowered to engage them.</p>   
                                    

                               <p>My dream is that curiosiBEE becomes a platform people are genuinely excited to use, a place where education is reimagined as joyful, powerful, and deeply human.</p>

                                <p>Hey there! I’m Saswat and I’m a robotics/mechatronics engineer at UNSW who just happens to have immense entrepreneurial sprit.</p> 
                                
                                <p>Ever since I was in school, I’ve always had strong interest for starting side hustles from reselling shoes, to starting off that drop-shipping gig we’ve all probably have started before 😆.</p>

                                <p>Currently I’m learning lot more about business and investing. I’m currently building a tutoring agency in Canberra, and have helped more than 20 students.</p>

                                <p>As I continue my pursuits in tutoring and education, I’ve seen firsthand through personal experiences and from my students, of the current issues in the Aussie education.</p>

                                <p>So what’s better than creating curiosiBEE with my 3 other amazing co-founders to combine our passion in helping the future of Aussie education.</p>

                                <p>Unlike the fluff in other edtech startups, we aim to make a true difference to education in Australia. Stay tuned, exciting stuff is to come!</p>

                                <p>Hey everyone, I'm Cing and I am studying Neuroscience and Computing.</p>

                                <p>If you check out my embarrassing GitHub bio from 2020/2021, I actually wrote that I was conflicted between doing something in the medical field, tech, or heading the entrepreneurial route. I am kind of doing all three things right now, so that is rather exciting!</p>

                                <p>I'm very passionate about education because I am both an educator and a student. As a student, I always yap about how the education system sucks, how some teachers suck, and how educational policies suck. As an educator, I am mindful of the issues in education but feel a bit stuck that I can't do much about it and just have to focus on teaching. As an entrepreneur, I am excited about EdTech innovation.</p>

                                <p>I am excited about how my team and I are going to build MOTIBEE. We changed our ideas a couple of times, and won't be surprised if we change some more. But one thing is certain: I hope we can disrupt traditional education.</p>

                                <p>I founded Ask Smart (https://asksmart.com.au/en/), providing software development services across e-commerce, logistics, workforce management, social networking, and EdTech. I focus on transforming ideas into real products, combining technical expertise with practical business solutions.</p>

                                <p>I believe education is the foundation of innovation and long-term social impact. With my combined academic and entrepreneurial background, I see EdTech as the perfect bridge to empower learners and create scalable, impactful solutions.</p>

                                <p>I hope to see curiosiBEE evolve into a platform that inspires students through personalized learning and gamified motivation, making education both effective and enjoyable.</p>
